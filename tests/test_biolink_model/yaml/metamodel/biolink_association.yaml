      Used to extend class or slot definitions. For example, if we have a core schema where a gene has two slots for
      identifier and symbol, and we have a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot
      systematic_name, we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism, adding the slot to this class,
      and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class. The new slot will be 'injected into' the gene class.

      specifies single-inheritance between classes or slots.
      While multiple inheritance is not allowed, mixins can be provided effectively providing the same thing.
      The semantics are the same when translated to formalisms that allow MI (e.g. RDFS/OWL). When translating to a SI
      framework (e.g. java classes, python classes) then is_a is used.
      When translating a framework without polymorphism (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is_a and mixins
      are recursively unfolded

      - >-
        When a slot range references a class with a value_from element, the possible values of the slot range are
        considered to be all URI's which satisfy the values_from target.  Typically this identifies URI's in a
        given ontology or any subclass of a given node.
