  affects:
    description: >-
      describes an entity that has a direct affect on the state or quality of another existing entity.
      Use of the 'affects' predicate implies that the affected entity already exists, unlike predicates s
      uch as 'affects risk for' and 'prevents, where the outcome is something that may or may not come to be.
