## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
## Children

 * [GenotypeToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](GenotypeToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - Any association between one genotype and a phenotypic feature, where having the genotype confers the phenotype, either in isolation or through environment

## Fields

 * [association slot](association_slot.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: any slot that relates an association to another entity
    * range: [String](String.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [association type](association_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [association.id](association_id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for an association
    * range: [IdentifierType](IdentifierType.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [genotype to thing association.subject](genotype_to_thing_association_subject.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * range: [Genotype](Genotype.md)
 * [negated](negated.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
    * range: [Boolean](Boolean.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [object](object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.

    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [publications](publications.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to publications supporting the association
    * range: [Publication](Publication.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [qualifiers](qualifiers.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [relation](relation.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: the relationship type by which a subject is connected to an object in an association
