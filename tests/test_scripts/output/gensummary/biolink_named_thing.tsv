Class Name	Parent Class	YAML Class Name	Description	Flags	Slot Name	YAML Slot Name	Range	Card	Slot Description	URI
AdministrativeEntity	NamedThing	administrative_entity

					description	value_description	str	0..1	A description of an example value or an abstract description of use	biolink:description
InformationContentEntity	NamedThing	information_content_entity	a piece of information that typically describes some piece of biology or is used as support.							
NamedThing	Thing	named_thing	an entity concept or class							
				K	id		IdentifierType	1..1	A unique identifier for a thing.  Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI	rdf:id
					subclass_of		UriType	0..*	The external ontology element that this is a subclass of	biolink:subclass_of
					category		*NamedThing	0..*	Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag	rdfs:subClassOf
					mixins	named_thing_mixins	*NamedThing	0..*	List of definitions to be mixed in. Targets may be any definition of the same type	biolink:mixins
					apply_to	apply_to_named_thing	*NamedThing	0..*	Used to extend class or slot definitions. For example, if we have a core schema where a gene has two slots for identifier and symbol, and we have a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot systematic_name, we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism, adding the slot to this class, and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class. The new slot will be 'injected into' the gene class.	biolink:apply_to
					is_a	named_thing_subclass_of	*NamedThing	0..1	specifies single-inheritance between classes or slots. While multiple inheritance is not allowed, mixins can be provided effectively providing the same thing. The semantics are the same when translated to formalisms that allow MI (e.g. RDFS/OWL). When translating to a SI framework (e.g. java classes, python classes) then is_a is used. When translating a framework without polymorphism (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is_a and mixins are recursively unfolded	rdfs:subClassOf
NodeType	NamedThing	node_type	the subject or object of a biolink association							
					union_of		*NodeType	0..*		biolink:union_of
Provider	AdministrativeEntity	provider	person, group, organization or project that provides a piece of information							
Publication	InformationContentEntity	publication	Any published piece of information. Can refer to a whole publication, or to a part of it (e.g. a figure, figure legend, or section highlighted by NLP). The scope is intended to be general and include information published on the web as well as journals.							
QualifierType	NamedThing	qualifier_type	information that modifies or qualifies the meaning of a biolink association							
RelationshipType	NamedThing	relationship_type	the predicate or relationship of a biolink association							
					domain		*NodeType	0..1		biolink:domain
					range		*NodeType	0..1		biolink:range
					edge_label		LabelType	0..1	A high-level grouping for the relationship_type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes.	biolink:edge_label
					relationship_quantifier		str	0..1		biolink:relationship_quantifier
					inverse		*RelationshipType	0..1	inverse relationship	biolink:inverse
					symmetric		*RelationshipType	0..1		biolink:symmetric
SubsetDefinition	NamedThing	subset_definition	the name and description of a subset							
Thing		thing	Top level class for both associations and named_things							
					name		LabelType	0..1	A human-readable name for a thing	rdfs:label
					description		NarrativeText	0..1	a human-readable description of a thing	dcterms:description
					alt_descriptions		AltDescription	0..*	alternative descriptions and names for an element, which may be attributed to a source	biolink:alt_descriptions
					aliases		str	0..*		skos:altLabel
					comments		str	0..*	notes and comments about an element intended for external consumption	skos:note
					notes		str	0..*	editorial notes about an element intended for internal consumption	skos:editorialNote
					examples		Example	0..*	example usages of an element	skos:example
					in_subset		*SubsetDefinition	0..*	used to indicate membership of a term in a defined subset of biolink terms used for a particular domain or application (e.g. the translator_minimal subset holding the minimal set of predicates used in a translator knowledge graph)	OIO:inSubset
					see_also		URIorCURIE	0..*	a reference	rdfs:seeAlso
					id_prefixes		NCName	0..*	a list of Curie prefixes that are used in the representation of instances of the model.  All prefixes in this list are added to the prefix sections of the target models.	biolink:id_prefixes
					full_name		LabelType	0..1	a long-form human readable name for a thing	biolink:full_name
					mixin		Bool	0..1	this slot or class can only be used as a mixin -- equivalent to abstract	biolink:mixin
					abstract		Bool	0..1	an abstract class is a high level class or slot that is typically used to group common slots together and cannot be directly instantiated.	biolink:abstract
					mappings		URIorCURIE	0..*	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have comparable meaning. These may include terms that are precisely equivalent, broader or narrower in meaning, or otherwise semantically related but not equivalent from a strict ontological perspective.	skos:mappingRelation
					exact_matches		URIorCURIE	0..*	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have strictly equivalent meanings.	skos:exactMatch
					broader_matches		URIorCURIE	0..*	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have a broader, more general meaning. Broader terms are typically shown as parents in a hierarchy or tree.	skos:broadMatch
					narrower_matches		URIorCURIE	0..*	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have a narrower, more specific meaning. Narrower terms are typically shown as children in a hierarchy or tree.	skos:narrowMatch
					close_matches		URIorCURIE	0..*	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have a semantically similar but not strictly equivalent, broader, or narrower meaning. Such terms often describe the same general concept from different ontological perspectives (e.g. drug as a type of chemical entity versus drug as a type of role borne by a chemical entity).	skos:closeMatch
					has_timepoint		TimeType	0..1	a point in time	biolink:has_timepoint
				R	iri		UriType	0..1	An IRI for the node. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.	biolink:iri
				R	imported_from		str	0..1	the imports entry that this element was derived from.  Empty means primary source	biolink:imported_from
					creation_date		XSDDateTime	0..1	date on which thing was created. This can be applied to nodes or edges	dcterms:created
